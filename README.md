# CPSC8420-PEGASUS---Abstractive-Summarization--Phase-3
A simple application for summarization that you can use without any previous experience in Natural Language Processing, HuggingFace Transformers, Pre-Trained Models, Tokenization or Encoding &amp; Decoding Architectures.

I use the "Newspaper3k" library to extract the text from any article links and "Gradio" library to create a friendly UI and then summarize them with "PEGASUS" model for abstractive summarization using "PEGASUS-XSUM" pre-trained model.

you have to run the whole code at once to launch the UI that you will use to summarize

before you copy and paste ypur link, you can see i've put some links as examples, you can open it to see what it talks about, then try to summarize it through the application to see how to works
